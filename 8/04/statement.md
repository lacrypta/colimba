# Exercise 8-4

The standard library function `int fseek(FILE *fp, long offset, int origin)` is identical to `lseek` except that `fp` is a file pointer instead of a file descriptor and the return value is an `int` status, not a position.

Write `fseek`.

Make sure that your `fseek` coordinates properly with the buffering done for the other functions of the library.
